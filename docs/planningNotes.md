# Project Planning
Hey all, sorry I can't make the meeting on Sunday. Just wanted to throw out some ideas: I know Shivram was talking about Cookie Clicker games and I also think those would be a great idea. I was looking through https://cookie-clicker.co/ for some ideas, and honestly I like the idea of just the basic cookie clicker game, and I am also slightly biased towards making a Doodle Jumpesque game (https://cookie-clicker.co/doodle-jump). To fit the specifications of the assignment, our database would not be too complicated. We can have a 'create user/login' and maybe do some cool displays with hiscores and such. I don't know too much about form verification and database accessing, but after assignment 4 I don't think it would be too far of a stretch for me to learn if needed. Also, A thing I was thinking about was hosting. I'm not sure if we need to actively host our project on a webpage, but I do know that people have recommended Netlify as a free resource that supports Node and Express. I looked into GitHub pages, but from what I've seen they have no serverside support so I don't think it's an option. Let me know thoughts, and I'll talk to you all soon!
